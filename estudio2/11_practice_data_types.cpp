// Numeric Types
// Use int when you need to store a whole number without decimals, 
// like 35 or 1000, and float or double when you need a floating point
// number (with decimals), like 9.99 or 3.14515.

// Boolean Types
// A boolean data type is declared with the bool keyword and can only take 
// the values true or false. When the value is returned, true = 1 and false = 0.

// Character Types
// The char data type is used to store a single character. The character must be 
// surrounded by single quotes, like 'A' or 'c':

// String Types
// The string type is used to store a sequence of characters (text). This is not a 
// built-in type, but it behaves like one in its most basic usage. String values must be surrounded by double quotes:

// To use strings, you must
